With the rising costs of water and energy resources, coupled with the global need for sustainability, the importance of conscious consumption in the home environment becomes evident. This conscious consumption is hampered by the lack of real-time information on the costs of everyday tasks, such as showering, leading to less adoption of more economical and sustainable habits. Based on this scenario, the main objective of this work is to develop an embedded system for monitoring the costs of showers with electric showerheads, providing the user with immediate information about their consumption. This objective will be achieved through the use of sensors coupled to a microcontroller, responsible for processing the data and making it available to the user. In this way, the aim is to promote conscious consumption, leading to a possible reduction in consumption.
